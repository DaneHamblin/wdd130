    <h2>A little about myself</h2>
    <p>Hi! My name is Dane Hamblin. I am 22 years old and I'm studying to become a video game developer. I'm married to the love of my life Caitlin Hamblin and we've been happily married for almost a whole Year now!</p>
    <p>Some of my hobbies include but are not limited to Watching anime and other tv series, playing video games (My current favorite being Elden Ring), playing basketball and golfing, and I also have a healthy appreciation for books.</p>
    <p>One of my current projects that I've been working on this year is growing a garden. I'm begun planting all sorts of cold weather crops inside and I'm waitng for it to be a little warmer outside before I put them in the ground, but so far, so good.</p>
