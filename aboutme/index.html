    <h2>A little about myself</h2>
    <p>Hi! My name is Dane Hamblin. I am 23 years old and I'm studying to become a video game developer. I'm married to the love of my life Caitlin Hamblin and we have a beautiful baby boy named Rhett. He's 6 months old and he is soo cute.</p>
    <p>Some of my hobbies include but are not limited to Watching anime and other tv series, playing video games (My current favorite being Elden Ring), playing basketball and golfing, and I also have a healthy appreciation for books.</p>
    <p>I am currently working as a phlebotomist at Grifols Biomat Plasma Donation Center. I've been working as a phlebotomist for over 3 years now. I enjoy getting to know people in the community that are regular donors.</p>
    <p>One other project that I've been working on for the last few months is a blacksmith simulator. It is my first video game that I am developing and I plan to have it finished by next Christmas. It has been soo much fun learning all the skills that go into video game development, such as Animation, Music, Foley art, and learning to use a game development engine. Anywasys I look forward to learnig how to build a website in this class and it is a pleasure to meet all of you.</p>
