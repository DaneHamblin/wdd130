    <h2>A little about myself</h2>
    <p>Hi! My name is Dane Hamblin. I am 22 years old and I'm studying to become a video game developer. I'm married to the love of my life Caitlin Hamblin and we have a beautiful baby boy named Rhett. He's 6 months old and he is soo cute.</p>
    <p>Some of my hobbies include but are not limited to Watching anime and other tv series, playing video games (My current favorite being Elden Ring), playing basketball and golfing, and I also have a healthy appreciation for books.</p>
    <p>I am currently working as a phlebotomist at Grifols Biomat Plasma Donation Center. I've been working as a phlebotomist for over 3 years now. I enjoy getting to know people in the community that are regular donors.</p>
