        •	Hill of Swords
        Hill of Swords is a story of a young barbarian that discovers that there’s more to life than gloriously dying in battle. This game takes you on a journey of self-discovery in a world that feels as if it is living and breathing. The player experiences a vast variety of different cultures and ways of life that may seem foreign at first, but quickly begins to feel like home.

        •	The World That Could’ve Been
        In this game that land is being overtaken by a mysterious black fog that consumes anything it touches. Inside the fog is a Shadow world that puts the player in a scenario that took place in this world’s history. The scenario might be a battle that took place years ago but was lost. You must find a way to turn that loss in to a victory. If a scenario is cleared the black fog recedes and the land is reclaimed. However, there are dark secrets found in the shadow worlds that have been forgotten in the history books.
